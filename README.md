## Getting Started

Create an account to keep track of your coding data and unlock access to advanced data visualizations in the Code Time dashboard and web app. You can customize your profile, such as your work hours and office type, for advanced time tracking. You can also connect Outlook or Google Calendar to visualize your code time vs. meetings in a single calendar.

Registering an account also lets you connect multiple code editors on multiple devices using the same email account. Your code time data will sync automatically across your devices.

Open Code Time in the sidebar and follow the **Getting Started** prompts to create a new account, or click **Log in** to sign into an existing account. 

## Protect Code Time

[Automatic Flow Mode](https://www.software.com/src/auto-flow-mode) makes it easy to eliminate distractions, mute notifications, and stay focused when you are in flow. It detects when you are in a high velocity coding session and automatically silences distractions and prevents interruptions. 

With Automatic Flow Mode, you can quickly toggle Zen mode or enter full screen. If you connect a Slack workspace, you can pause notifications, update your profile status, and set your presence to *away*. If you connect Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook, you can also block time on your calendar. You can customize Flow Mode by clicking the gear icon at the the top of the Code Time sidebar. 

If you'd prefer to turn on Flow Mode manually during each coding session, you can enable or disable Automatic Flow Mode from the Code Time settings view. Make sure to hit the save button after you're done updating your settings. To then turn on Flow Mode manually, click *Enter Flow Mode* in the sidebar to toggle your flow automations. Once you are in Flow Mode, click *Exit Flow Mode* to resume receiving notifications and reset your Slack status. 

## Track Development Metrics

![Code Time programming metrics](https://assets.software.com/readme/code-time/vscode/measure-progress-2.5.0.png)

Your coding stats can help you understand how you are improving over time.

Your status bar shows you in real-time how many hours and minutes you code each day. A rocket will appear if your active code time exceeds your daily average on this day of the week.

To see an overview of your coding activity and project metrics, open the **Code Time panel** by clicking on the Code Time icon in your sidebar. Click **Dashboard** to open your personalized Code Time dashboard in a new editor tab. Your dashboard summarizes your coding data — such as your code time, code time outside work hours, and meeting time — yesterday, last week, and over the last 90 days. 

Your _code time_ is the total time you have spent in your editor today. Your _active code time_ is the time you spend actively writing and editing code in your editor or IDE. It captures periods of intense focus and flow. Each metric shows how you compare today to your personal averages. Each average is calculated by day of week over the last 90 days (e.g. a Friday average is an average of all previous Fridays).

## Explore Data Visualizations

![Code Time web app](https://assets.software.com/readme/code-time/vscode/visualize-everything.png)

Click **More data at software.com** in the Code Time sidebar or visit [app.software.com](https://app.software.com) to see more advanced data visualizations. You will need to create a free Software account to use the web app. In the Code Time dashboard, you will be able to track: 

**Active code time.** Visualize your daily active code time. See productivity trends compared to 90-day averages. See how you stack up against the Software community of over 250,000 developers.

**Meeting time.** Connect your [Google Calendar](https://www.software.com/integrations/google-calendar) or [Outlook Calendar](https://www.software.com/integrations/microsoft-outlook) to visualize meeting time versus code time.

**Work-life balance.** See how much coding happens during work hours versus nights and weekends so you can find ways to improve your work-life balance.

## Measure Key DevOps Metrics

![Software.com DevOps Metrics](https://assets.software.com/readme/code-time/vscode/bottlenecks-take-action.png)

*Software* makes it easy to measure your team's key DevOps metrics, including [lead time](https://www.software.com/devops-guides/lead-time) and [delivery velocity](https://www.software.com/devops-guides/delivery-velocity-score). With better visibility, you can quickly find and fix bottlenecks in your delivery pipeline. 

**Diagnose bottlenecks with alerts.** Monitors automatically notify you when metrics cross a certain threshold (like when [code reviews take longer](https://www.software.com/src/code-reviews-bottleneck-in-your-delivery-pipeline) to review, approve, or merge), so you can take action and prevent delays.

**Customize dashboards to track DevOps efficiency.** Organize, visualize, and monitor the engineering metrics you care about most — like lead time, delivery frequency, and pull request review time. 

**Benchmark your DevOps performance.** According to research from DORA, Google Cloud's DevOps Research and Assessment team, elite engineering teams have 973x more frequent code deployments and 6570x faster lead time. With Software, you can compare your delivery speed and efficiency with other high-performing engineering organizations in our global community.

To see your team's DevOps metrics, visit the [web app](https://app.software.com) and connect the [*Software* GitHub App](https://bit.ly/software-github) to your Software account. It's free and takes just a few minutes.

## It’s Safe, Secure, and Free

**We never access your code:** We do not read, transmit, or store source code. We only provide metrics about programming, and we make it easy to see the data we collect. You can learn more about how we secure your data on our [security page](https://www.software.com/security).

**Your data is private:** We will never share your individually identifiable data with your boss. When you create or join a team, we only show system-level metrics for your GitHub organization.

**Free for you, forever:** We provide 90 days of data history for free, forever. We provide [premium plans](https://www.software.com/pricing) for advanced features and historical data access.

Code Time also collects basic usage metrics to help us make informed decisions about our roadmap.
